For Lecture 20 we will keep discussing ridge regression and lasso.  All those are covered in ISLR Ch 6.2.  

Also we will discuss Nychka and Saltzman, in this directory.  Focus on Sections 1, 2 and 4.  Questions to ponder:
1. What are their main answers to the question posed in Section 1.2, "Why Find Spatial Predictions for Ozone?"
2. Section 2.1: Why do the authors average their data?  Could they be missing anything important by doing this?
4. Section 4.1: Be prepared to describe in words the model the authors are fitting to the data.  Is this a meaningful model to estimate?  Why or why not?
5. Section 4.2, paragraph 3 to end of Section 4.2:  How does their formulation of the lasso procedure differ from what we learned in class?  Can you see how the two formulations could get similar results?  How does <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\lambda" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda" title="\lambda" /></a> in the formulation we learned relate to <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=t" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t" title="t" /></a> in the formulation presented in this paper? 
6. Section 4.3: Be prepared to comment on their model validation procedure.  How might you improve on it?  What problems are they exposed to by taking the approach they do?
7. Interpretation.  Think about ways in which this approach might be practically applied to improving our understanding of air quality.  Can it be adpated to address equity issues in situations where monitoring stations are sparse?
