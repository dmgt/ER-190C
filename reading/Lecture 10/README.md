Please read pages 305-308 of Alstone et al, in this directory.  

We will focus on the following topics for discussion:

1. Review Figure 1 in detail.  From a visualization perspective, what features of the figure do you appreciate?  Do you think it could be improved upon?
1. In the section **Electricity and human development**, the authors state that their figure is 'consistent with an aggregate view of household-level diminishing returns on energy consumption....'  Discuss what the authors mean by this statement.  Do you agree?
2. In the section **The electricity continuum**, the authors argue that 'By overcoming access barriers, often through market-based structures, these systems provide incremental and often substantial increases in access to services, compared with the status quo.'  Contrast this statement to the premise of Lee *et al* (which we read last week).  Is Alstone *et al*'s view consistent or in conflict with Lee *et al*?
