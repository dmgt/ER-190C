For Lecture 14 we'll have in-class discussion on Clark, Millet and Marshall's paper, *National Patterns in Environmental Injustice and Inequality: Outdoor NO2 Air Pollution in the United States*, in this directory.  

Some questions to focus on:
1. In the second paragraph of the "Statistical Analysis" section the authors describe how their measures are not available for the entire population.  For example, combined race-income metrics are available for only 38\% of the population because the census collects income data for only one person per household.   Is there potential sampling bias?  How might that bias impact the way you interpret your results?

2. First paragraph of the Results and Discussion:  Urban American Indian populations have lower NO2 exposures than urban whites.  Try to explain why this might be the case.

3. First paragraph of the Results and Discussion:  The paper reports p-values for concentration differences between groups.  These concern the probability that the *average* concentration values are meaningfully different.  The authors do not mention including uncertainty in their LUR forecasts in the calculation of these p-values.  Discuss if and how this might affect the significance of their results.  

4. What actionable information or recommendations are contained in the introduction and conclusions?  What additional actions might you suggest from your reading of the paper?
