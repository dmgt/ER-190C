    "**Seaborn** is a Python data visualization library that is built on top of matplotlib. It offers a higher level of abstraction, and arguably more attractive-looking graphics. Below is a histogram plotted using seaborn. Because of its higher level of abstraction, seaborn can plot elements on a graph that would usually require extra calculation using our usual libraries (e.g., a linear regression line; or the kernel density estimation curve overlayed on the top of this histogram). A great option for plotting a univariate distribution of observations is seaborn [distplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.distplot.html), which combines matplotlib histogram with seaborn kde and rugplot. \n",
