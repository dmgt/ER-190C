For Lecture 20 we will keep discussing ridge regression and lasso.  All those are covered in ISLR Ch 6.2.  

Also we will discuss Nychka and Saltzman, in this directory.  Questions to focus on:
1. What are their main answers to the question posed in Section 1.2, "Why Find Spatial Predictions for Ozone?"
2. Section 2.1: Why do the authors average their data?  Could they be missing anything important by doing this?
3. Section 2.3: The authors train their models on simulated data.  What are some important things to consider when they interpret their errors?
4. Section 4.1: Be prepared to describe in words the model the authors are fitting to the data.  Is this a meaningful model to estimate?  Why or why not?
5. Section 4.2, paragraph 3 to end of Section 4.2:  How does their formulation of the lasso procedure differ from what we learned in class?  Can you see how the two formulations could get similar results?  How does $\lambda$ in the formulation we learned relate to $t$ in the formulation presented in this paper?
